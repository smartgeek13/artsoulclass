        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>To create a supportive, safe and peaceful environment for those recently diagnosed with cancer, those in survivorship,
        their families and caregivers to experience connection, compassion, creativity, stress reduction while improving emotional
        health and wellbeing through mindfulness and art.</p>
        
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>For individuals dealing with cancer, survivors, their families and caregivers at El Camino Cancer Center to experience a
            sense of community and support by connecting with others through guided imagery and art. The goal of this proposal
            aligns with the mission of the Cancer Center in creating strong a relationship with community and helping patients needs
            be supported at this difficult time in their lives. An article American Journal of Public Health noted that “In a quantitative
            trial of mindfulness art therapy targeted toward women with cancer …. found that those who engaged in art making
            demonstrated statistically significant decreases in symptoms of physical and emotional distress during treatment.”* Another
            article from the Journal of Nursing Scholarships sites that “family caregivers reported significantly reduced stress,
            lowered anxiety, and increased positive emotions following creative art participation.” ** <br><br> Each class will bring to patients 
            and caregivers an opportunity to reduce stress, connect mind and body, allow freedom ofexpression through art, share experiences, have fun and heal.</p>
      
        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>Reduce stress, increase motivation to be healthy, promote community, and feel supported in the cancer journey. Mindfulness
            brings the attention back into the body and quiets the racing of everyday thoughts. Creating art allows for free expression
            and the ability to express what is hard to put into words. This program hopes to inspire people to open to their
            creative side in a supportive environment. Being able to express in this way is fun and insightful and creates a dialogue
            that helps to form connection and community. In the creative experience much is revealed and healed.</p>
